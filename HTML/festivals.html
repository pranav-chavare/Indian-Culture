                <li><h2>Diwali:-</h2></li>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Diwali marks the start of the Hindu New Year and lasts for five days. The exact date changes
                     every year as it follows the Hindu calendar, but Diwali generally occurs between October 
                     and November. It’s known as the Hindu Festival of Lights as people decorate their homes 
                     with lights and ‘diyas’, or oil lights, because they’re said to help the goddess of wealth
                      find her way to peoples’ homes. People will often draw ‘rangoli’, patterns made of coloured
                       powders and flowers, on the floor at the entrance to their homes as a welcome to the gods.

                     Feasts are held, gifts are exchanged and firecrackers are let loose its a beautiful and 
                     entertaining time to be anywhere in India.

                <li><h2>Holi:-</h2></li>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When most Westerners think of an Indian festival, they think of Holi. It’s one of the most 
                    celebrated festivals in the country and is famous for the vibrant coloured powders that are
                     thrown through the streets. Red symbolises love and fertility; blue represents Krishna, a 
                     Hindu God; green represents new beginnings; and yellow represents turmeric, a powder 
                     native to India.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holi is sometimes known as the Festival of Love, sometimes the Festival of Colour, but 
                    whatever you call it, Holi celebrates the triumph of good over evil. It lasts for a night
                     and a day and is filled with singing, playing and waterbombs, while the celebrations begin
                      on the first evening with a bonfire to burn Holika, a Hindu demoness.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The festival changes dates based on the Hindu calendar but usually occurs in March, on the 
                    last full moon day of the month marking spring.

                <li><h2>Dussehra:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Hindu festival, Dussehra celebrates the victory of Rama over the demon king Ravana,
                     who carried off Lord Rama’s wife Sita. This was, it seems, frowned upon, but don’t worry
                      – good triumphed over evil, and now it’s time to party. Celebrations include bonfires, 
                      fireworks and burning effigies of the demon king Ravana, while red spots are also painted 
                      on people’s foreheads. This festival usually occurs in October.

                <li><h2>Ganesh Chaturthi Festival:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganesha is the god of new beginnings, success and wisdom and can be quite easily identified
                     thanks to his elephant head. Of all the gods that make up the Hindu religion, he’s one of 
                     the most well-known, and the Ganesh Chaturthi Festival is held in his honour to celebrate 
                     his birth. Usually held in August/September, the festival lasts for 11 days and sees huge 
                     statues built, displayed and worshipped in both homes and public areas. On the final day, 
                     the statues are paraded through the streets, with thousands of followers dancing and 
                     singing alongside, before finally being immersed in the ocean.

                <li><h2>Krishna Janmashtami:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This festival commemorates the birth of Lord Krishna, who is revered for his positive 
                    attitude towards life and his ability to smile through life and death, and victory and
                     defeat. The festival is usually held in late August or early September, depending on the 
                     year, and the highlight is the ‘Dahi Handi’. Clay pots containing money, butter and curd 
                     are strung up from buildings and people compete with each other to reach the pots by 
                     forming a human pyramid and clambering to the top. There’s a perfectly reasonable 
                     explanation for this bizarre spectacle – Lord Krishna absolutely loved butter and curd, 
                     and would try to take it from homes, so the villagers would hang it out of his reach. 
                     The story goes that he roped his friends into helping him climb up and reach it.

                <li><h2>Eid-ul-Fitr:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and is one of the most important 
                    Islamic festivals. To celebrate, Muslims attend communal prayers, decorate their homes and
                     exchange food and gifts with friends. There’s also a charity donation of rice from wealthy
                      families to the needy. One of the best places to see the celebrations is at Jama Masjid,
                       one of the largest mosques in India, which was built in the mid-17th century.

                <li><h2>Gujarat Kite Festival:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large, colourful and unusual kites flood the skies of Gujarat each January to commemorate 
                    the start of summer and the beginning of harvest. Purchase your own at Patang Bazaar, a 
                    famous kite market, or just watch the others dance through the sky.

                <li><h2>Pushkar Camel Fair:-</h2></li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of camels (and their owners dressed in their finest garb) descend upon Rajasthan's
                     Pushkar for the annual camel fair. Camels are traded and raced, acrobats and performers 
                     entertain crowds at a nearby fair, while finely dressed males and bejewelled females take
                      the chance to let their hair down.
