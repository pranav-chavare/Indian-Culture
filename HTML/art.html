        <h2>Following are some art and architecture of India:</h2>
        <h3>The art and architecture of India have a rich and diverse history spanning thousands of years, characterized by various influences, cultural exchanges, and regional styles. Here's an overview of some key periods and aspects:</h3>

<h3>1. Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1300 BCE):</h3> 
<p>While not much is known about their art, archaeological findings reveal sophisticated urban planning, with evidence of pottery, seals, jewelry, and sculpture.</p>

<h3>2. Buddhist Art (c. 3rd century BCE–c. 1st century CE):</h3> 
<p>During this period, particularly under the Maurya and Gupta empires, Buddhist art flourished. The Gandhara and Mathura schools of art produced iconic sculptures of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.</p>

<h3>3. Classical Hindu Art (c. 4th–12th century CE):</h3> 
<p>This period saw the development of classical Hindu temple architecture, characterized by intricate carvings, elaborate sculptures, and towering spires (shikharas). Famous examples include the temples at Khajuraho, Ellora, and Mahabalipuram.</p>

<h3>4. Islamic Architecture (c. 12th century onwards):</h3> 
<p>With the arrival of Islam, India saw the rise of various Islamic dynasties like the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Mughal architecture blended Persian, Indian, and Central Asian styles, seen in iconic structures such as the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort.</p>

<h3>5. Indo-Islamic Architecture (c. 12th century onwards):</h3> 
<p>This style emerged from the fusion of Islamic and Indian architectural elements, seen in structures like the Qutub Minar in Delhi and the Jama Masjid in Agra.</p>

<h3>6. Colonial Influence (c. 17th–20th century):</h3> 
<p>European colonial powers, particularly the British, influenced Indian architecture, leading to the development of the Indo-Saracenic style, which combined Western and Indian architectural elements. Examples include the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>

<h3>7. Modern and Contemporary Art (c. 20th century onwards):</h3> 
<p>Indian art underwent significant transformations in response to modernity and globalization. Artists like Rabindranath Tagore, Amrita Sher-Gil, and F.N. Souza contributed to the development of modern Indian art, while contemporary artists like Subodh Gupta, Bharti Kher, and Anish Kapoor continue to make waves on the global art scene.</p>

<p><b>Throughout its history, India has been home to a diverse array of artistic expressions, including painting, sculpture, architecture, textiles, and crafts, each reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage and spiritual traditions.</b></p>
