            Indian Literature and Folklore are precious assets of the country. The idea behind the word ‘folk’
             has a range of implications. It can mean native or rural. In a few cases, it also refers to ‘from 
             the heart’. The folklores are generally a tradition, orally narrated from spread among the 
             community from one person to another. The word ‘lore’ is the myth, consisting of the beliefs and 
             traditions made into story format and told while exploring the places. During the ancient days,
              knowledge was passed on from one generation to another through these folklores. Indian 
              traditional literature was based on these narratives, where the culture could be explored. 
              The folklores were similar to the written literature, with both verse narratives and prose.
               However, different cultures had their exclusive folklores, contrary to the literature, which 
               forms any written work.
