        <h2>Impact on Indian Culture:-</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of Globalization can be tracked by examining the various trends of the
            social and cultural patterns during the early stages and as of today. The Era of Globalization'
            is fast becoming the preferred term for describing the current times. The vigor of the renewed
            sense of self-awareness generated among the members of the local cultures and communities
            is such as to succeed in making adaptive reconciliation with the forces of globalization. The
            linkages both visible and invisible, defining the cultural interdependence among communities
            and regions in India which have existed historically, reinforce instead of threatening the
            national identity. The impact of globalization is great on India’s culture. We are exploiting
            the term globalization in the name of reason, progress and science but we are forgetting that
            it is our culture that differentiates us from any other country. India has a rich cultural
            background and pride of its culture is famous in all over world. Globalization has not only
            inculcated the westernization in India, but conversely the Indian culture has also spred its impact globally.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developed countries have been trying to pursue the developing countries for the liberation of trade and to allow flexibility in business policies to provide opportunities to MNCs in the Indian market. They are helped by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in this endeavor.

            Indian government liberalized trade and investment after pressure from World Trade Organization.
            Import duties were cut down phase-wise to allow MNCs to operate in India on basis of equality.
            The growth of foreign investments in fields of the corporate, retail, and scientific sectors is enormous in the country. This has a tremendous impact on social, monetary, cultural, and political areas.
            The growth of global trade, doctrines, and culture can be seen in India.
            Indian society changed drastically with urbanization and globalisation and economic policies came to influence the framework of the country’s economy.
            Cross-country culture and cosmopolitanism are important impacts of globalisation on the society of India.</p>
        <h2>Adaptation and Preservation:-</h2>
        <p>The introduction of globalisation changed Indian society drastically. Globalisation and the Indian economy became interrelated, and next economic policies displayed a direct influence of this change.


            Government shaped administrative policies according to it as well. The aim was to promote business opportunities in this country, generate employment, and attract global investments.
            
            
            Globalisation of the Indian economy also witnessed an impact on its culture. Introduction to other societies and their norms brought various changes to the culture of this country as well.
            
            
            Furthermore, India is one of those countries that attain economic success after the implementation of this concept. The introduction and growth of foreign investment in major sectors of this country fuelled the rise of the Indian economy even further.</p>
                <h2><li>Benefits of Globalisation of Indian Economy:-</li></h2>
                <p>The concept of globalisation in India resulted in the following benefits that helped to transform the Indian economy and the country as a whole –<br>
                
                
                1. More Employment Opportunities:-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of globalisation brought an influx of foreign investments and the favorable policies of the Indian government also helped companies to set up units in this country. This has resulted in new employment opportunities. Also, access to low-cost labor prompted foreign businesses to outsource work to companies operating here.
                
                In a nutshell, the employment opportunities in this country rapidly progressed after globalisation and Indian business merged.<br>
                
                
                2. Increase in per-capita Income:-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a direct effect of more employment opportunities, the per-capita income of Indian households also increased after globalisation.
                
                
                Resultantly, it altered their standard of living and improved the purchasing power of an average Indian. This gave birth to a new middle-class and recorded an increase in demand for consumer products in this country.<br>
                
                
                3. More Choices for Consumers:-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and the Indian economy provided Indian consumers with a plethora of choices. Indian, as well as foreign manufacturers, brought various products of the same kind, and consumers got a chance to select their preferred one.
                
                
                This increase in competition prompted manufacturers to create better products at a much lower price point.<br>
                
                
                4. Access to Untapped Markets:-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noticeable benefit of globalisation is that it provides access to many untapped markets with huge potential. The globalisation of the Indian economy means it allowed foreign companies to operate in the Indian market. Also, Indian businesses got an opportunity to operate on a global scale. As a result, the import-export sector in India saw an astonishing rise after 1991.
