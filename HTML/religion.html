        <h2><li>Hinduism in India:-</li></h2>
        <p>
            Hinduism – the most widely followed religion in India – can be interpreted diversely. Pinpointing 
            what constitutes Hinduism is difficult, with some suggesting that it is an umbrella term that 
            encompasses various religions and traditions within it. Nonetheless, Hinduism in all its forms has 
            been particularly influential in Indian society.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hinduism continues to thrive in modern-day India. The religion affects everyday life and social 
            interactions among people through the many Hindu-inspired festivities, artistic works and temples.
             There is also a continuing revival of the classical epic narratives of the Ramayana (Ramas 
             Journey) and the Mahabharata (The Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty) through the medium of film
              and television. The Krishna Lila (The Playful Activities of Krishna) is another popular tale 
              among many villages.
        </p>
        <h2><li>Buddhism in India:-</li></h2>
        <p>Buddhism originated as a countermovement to early Hinduism by presenting a universal ethic rather 
            than basing ethical codes on an individual’s caste. The core doctrine of Buddhism, known as the 
            ‘Four Noble Truths’, teaches that one can be liberated from the suffering that underpins the cycle
             of death and rebirth by practising the ‘Noble Eightfold Path’. Buddhism has become more widely 
             practised in India over the last 30 years. This is partially due to the increased migration of 
             exiled Buddhist monks from Tibet. However, its popularity has also increased as many from the 
             'untouchables' caste view it as a viable alternative to Hinduism in contemporary Indian society.
              Many Buddhists reside in the states of Maharashtra, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir.
            </p>
            <h2><li>Jainism in India:-</li></h2>
            <p>
                Jainism also originated as a countermovement that opposed some of the teachings and doctrines 
                of early Hinduism. In modern-day India, layperson Jains usually uphold the ethical principle 
                of ‘ahimsa’ (‘non-harm’ or ‘non-violence’). As such, Jains tend to promote vegetarianism and 
                animal welfare. Another common practice in the Jain lay community is samayika, a meditative 
                ritual intended to strengthen one's spiritual discipline. Samayika is often practised in a 
                religious setting, such as a temple, before a monk, or in one's home. Most Jains reside in 
                Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.
            </p>
            <h2><li>Sikhism in India:-</li></h2>
            <p>
                Originating in India, Sikhism is a monotheistic religion that promotes devotion to a formless 
                God. The religion is centred on a tenet of service, humility and equality, encouraging its 
                followers to seek to help those less fortunate or in need. For example, it is common for Sikhs 
                to offer food to those visiting a gurdwara (the primary place of worship for Sikhs). One of the
                 most recognised symbols of the Sikh community is a Sikh turban (known as a ‘dastar’ or a 
                 ‘dumalla’) worn by many men and some women. Since the partition of India and Pakistan, most 
                 Sikhs in India have resided in the Punjab region.
            </p>
            <h2><li>Islam in India:-</li></h2>
            <p>
                Islam is the second most followed religion in India, influencing the country's society, culture
                , architecture and artistry. The partition of the subcontinent in 1947 led to mass emigration 
                of roughly 10 million Muslims to Pakistan and nearly as many Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan 
                into India. This event changed the demographics of both countries significantly and is 
                continually felt throughout India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonetheless, the Islamic community in India continues to play a considerable role in the 
                development of the country. For example, the Muslim community in India has contributed to 
                theological research and the establishment of religious facilities, institutes and universities.
                 The mystical strain of Islam (Sufism) is also popular, with people gathering to watch Sufi dance
                  performances. The majority of Muslims are Sunni, but there are also influential Shi'ite 
                  minorities in Gujarat. Most Sunnis reside in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and
                   Kerala as well as major cities.
            </p>
            <h2><li>Christianity in India:-</li></h2>
            <P>
                Christianity is the third most followed religion in India, mostly concentrated in the far south
                 and Mumbai. The most prominent denomination of Christianity in India is Roman Catholicism, but
                  there are also localised Christian churches (such as the Church of North India and the Church 
                  of South India). Converts to Christianity have come mainly from traditionally disadvantaged 
                  minorities such as lower castes and tribal groups.
